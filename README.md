# CS Collaboration Discord

A student-led initiative to create a university-wide Discord community for Computer Science students to collaborate, share resources, and connect.  
Includes a custom-built Discord bot to facilitate structured Q&A, study groups, AI-assisted features, and job networking â€” all while respecting academic integrity.

## Goals
- Foster collaboration and peer-to-peer learning in the CS community.
- Provide role-based channels for courses, career topics, and social interaction.
- Develop a Discord bot to automate Q&A, resource sharing, and study group formation.
- Integrate AI responsibly for question summarization and FAQ search.
- Maintain strong moderation and governance policies.
